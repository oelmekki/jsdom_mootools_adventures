This repos is an attempt to get jsdom working with mootools-runner.

The goal is to be able to fully test mootools and mootools related
projects with node.js. Event if this can't replace classical browser
testing, this could help writing code in a bdd process.


Problems encountered and solutions
==================================

Request dependency
------------------

Jsdom introduce an unnecessary dependency, "request".
[see the issue](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/closed#issue/78)
